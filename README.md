## üìå First require
+This is onr of my Beginning project.
+ I sometimes make refer on the internet but they seem like very difficult.
+ Now, i am enhancing update code for better. Let wait...

## üé® used
+ Java Core 8 and Java Swing basic.
+ Function, loop, algorithms, implement, extend, Thread in Java.
+ UML diagram in programming.
+ Design pattern (although it hasn't really been applied completely, but overall I'm trying to make it happen).
+ Refferent on StackOverflow and google

## üöÄ Some of our core summaries
+ Explore and learn how the Java language works through libraries and methods.
+ Familiarize yourself with object oriented programming and its working principle.
+ Introduce the Java Swing and java.awt libraries through implementation and method inheritance its.
+ An overview of Design patterns and their operation diagrams.
+ Using the UML diagram to analys codes and information processing.
+ Understand how multithreading works and manage it.
+ Take advantage of the I/O mechanism to download files to local and open URL on broswer.
+ Learn about system manipulation with Buffer and Builder in Java.
+ Manipulating arrays, strings, and algorithm structures.
+ Skills in selecting, processing images and sounds to suit the project.
+ Expanding programming thinking and improve your skills to resolve the problems through the game.
+ Practice writing reports and summarizing project issues.
+ Good for programmers who are new to the Java language.
+ Practice and complete assignment Java OOP projects in a university lab.

## üì∏ How it looks



## ‚öî How to play this game
* Fork and clone this project to local destop.
* Run it by IDE for Java which JRE and JDK installed.
* click new game button to play new.
* Start playing and control the snake with the arrows keys "**UP**", "**DOWN**", "**LEFT**" and "**RIGHT**", simulating a user interaction with the game.

| <code>‚Üë</code> | <code>‚Üì</code> | <code>‚Üê</code> | <code>‚Üí</code> |
